# Entity Template
This directory has scripts that automation the creation of entities in the game.
An entity can be the following:
* An item like a flask, or the Loopy power up.
* A mob
* A NPC
* A player
    * Note that players in this game are NFTs so they are not handled by the scripts in this directory.

The following commands require being in the `looperlands/entity_template` directory.

```bash
